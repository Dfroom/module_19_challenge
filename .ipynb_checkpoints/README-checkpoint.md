Please note that as I am a mac user my .env file is not visable. It can be viewed on mac using "nano .env" while on the correct directory in terminal. 

## Issues ##
I ran into significant issues with the starting code.
Many variables and functions had improper names or formatting, especially in the crypto_wallet.py file.
These issues led me to spend a considerable amount of time just debugging the starter code.
One examples is the to_wei and from_wei originally being fromWei and toWei which did not worka nd led to many errors needing to be trouble shooted.
These were largely resolved by using internet forums and people having the same issue in the past.
